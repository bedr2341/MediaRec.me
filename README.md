## Setup
Follow the guides below for each of the following 

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Open a new terminal. Type the following and hit enter:

```curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash```

Close your terminal, then open a new one and type this:

```nvm ls```

You will see something like this:

```system
iojs -> N/A (default)
node -> stable (-> N/A) (default)
unstable -> N/A (default)
nvm_list_aliases:36: no matches found: /Users/adeelimran/.nvm/alias/lts/*
```

Next in your terminal type:

```nvm install 12.18.1```

Once it is installed, it is ready to be used. To use this version, just type this in your terminal:

```nvm use 12.18.1```

Now that it is installed let's check it by doing the following:

```node --v```

This will output "v12.18.1" (which is the NodeJS version you just installed)


To uninstall Node use 
>rm -rf $NVM_DIR ~/.npm ~/.bower




##### For MAC OS(requires [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)):
```brew install node```
